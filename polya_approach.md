# Polya Approach
## Step 1 - Understand the problem
- Clearly identify what you're being asked to do 
- Gather all available information 
- Identify constraints and limitations 
- Restate the problem in your own words

I want to make sure I understand this problem correctly. Could you:
1. Restate this problem in plain English
2. List all explicit requirements
3. Identify any implicit requirements
4. Point out any ambiguous aspects that need clarification

## Step 2 - Devising a plan
### PART 2A
For this problem, please analyze:
1. What common programming patterns might be applicable?
2. What similar problems have you seen before?
3. What makes this problem similar or different from known patterns?
4. Which pattern would be most appropriate and why?
